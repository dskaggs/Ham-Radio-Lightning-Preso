Lightning talk on Amateur Radio's role in emergency communications

This is a "Lightning Talk" I gave at the cf.Objective() 2012 conference in Minneapolis, MN in May 2012. The focus of the presentation was to demonstrate some of the ways which amateur radio operators assist government and civilian organizations with communications needs in times of emergencies.

The video of this presentation is available on YouTube at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44qfcljT2Qg (pardon the noise from the camera panning).
